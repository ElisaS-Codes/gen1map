# Pokemon Generation 1 Interactive Map
 
## What
This is an interactive map of the first gens of Pokemon, check every item, every sign and every npc, check their mons and find that TM you want from the search bar, or where you can capture your fave mons!

## Why
I tried to do a living pokede in Yellow, and tried to get all TMs and Key items, just for brag. And, while I finished it and had a blast, I was a bit shocked that not all that info was in a single place! I had one site for the TMs, one site to quickly check what pokemons where exclusives, another to check witch evolutions where available or not, and finally, when I wanted to check, for example, where to find the highest level Pidgeotto, so i didnt have to waste to much time leveling it, I had to open each route where Pidgeotto can be found on Bulbapedia to check.
Thats BS, so, I decided to make this site! Everything you need to know, in a simple map, with a searchbar to warp you to what you need!
